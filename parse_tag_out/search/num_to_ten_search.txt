you're threeandahalf  not three . 
let me count on  ten first . 
so far we've got three . 
Ethan is the one who's very sick . 
and if  and if she should wake up one of these she should wake up Carla . 
keep  one eye on this side and one eye on that side . 
he should been the second one dressed . 
two people where late and somebody else found it . 
she wakes up Ethan and he's the sickest one and she should wake up Cara . 
and she's the one who dialled the northpole ? 
one . 
he just turned two . 
remember yesterday was his two  . 
they said Andrew could you babysit this kid for five minutes . 
and so he left  they left their three tiny newborn babies . 
instead he babysitted eight kids for a hour . 
twenty four hours . 
I mean for twenty eight hours  . 
he can even babysit some babies for two nights . 
would you like a break from all  two babies ? 
I think we have one missing in that . 
cause they both have  and these two are gonna really look like each other . 
who's  erhm five dollars ? 
five dollars or five cents ? 
five pennies and five dollars . 
she said five dollars cause I  
one  nickel . 
it looks like this little one's asleep . 
she  he babysits two of them . 
all of these three are awake . 
one . 
two . 
I can do two in a row . 
I could do three in a row but I just don't get it  . 
one . 
seven  . 
one two . 
one two . 
one  . 
that was about three  . 
you dropped one , Sue . 
this is probably gonna be about three in a row . 
one two three .  
and  two . 
this one's probably gonna be three in a row and you  let it get caught . 
one two . 
one two three .  
this is probably gonna be three in a row . 
one two three .  
four dollars  would realy be enough . 
maybe five he might earn . 
for five weeks ? 
five  how about five months ? 
because five months is longer . 
how about four weeks ? 
four months . 
I mean  four months . 
four  months will be just right . 
Andrew starts his first day of school one day after four months . 
just take one or two at a time  .

put your brush in this one . 
I'm gonna look in one second . 
I don't care what this one looks like . 
and I have one penny  less . 
we go to the market there's something one penny . 
three dollars and sixteen cents by accident instead of fifteen and you know what ? 
we can buy something that's one penny . 
which one ? 
because then you'll have like two twins and they look just like Billy  . 
you could have two babies and that Cara if you want . 
or two twin babies and then not Cara ? 
there's  two dolls there . 
one baby has a pink blanket in your family ...  
and one baby has a white blanket in your family  . 
this one is the carlight . 
and this one is  the regular light . 
and that one's the carlight . 
I do not have to nurse that one  . 
but you have two babies . 
you just had your two twins . 
you've got two twins and they're just the same age . 
I've got a great thing to be one of your baby's blankets . 
but if you do  would need one I think it's good to take one blanket . 
this one's  very cute for Jonathon . 
see this one ? 
I think this one is Melinda , , right ? 
this one's Melinda . 
pretend  that one's mine . 
it's only seventy four . 
and you can take care of one of Sue's baby's for her . 
you know , you don't have to look one bit at Melinda . 
you don't have to worry one thing about her .

I've got two bags there  why don't we steam up some . 
let's do the yellow chicken on this one and we'll do the turtle on something lighter  okay ? 
here's a good turtle one . 
and what about the other one ? 
maybe he doesn't want anybody else to have one . 
how are you going to know which one's yours ? 
who else has one ? 
do you ever get confused which one is yours ? 
how do you know which which one is yours ? 
and which is the worst one ? 
the one one that really scares you ? 
as soon as you finish that one  I'll give you another one . 
we have two types of aspirin . 
why don't you ever give me the one to suck on ? 
because there's only one . 
I lost the other one . 
well  there must be another one . 
you show Mom and maybe she can find out where the other one is . 
oh  either one . 
and so do you need one ? 
you know the one about the little boy and his daddy . 
" there's only one Bat Man and I'm it . 
" well that's two . 
" which one are you gonna be ? 
" no  you don't have one because I looked all over and you didn't have one . 
you like that one better ? 
I'm going to be gone for two nights .

okay  little one . 
no one will be bad to me . 
let me ask you another one . 
now  let me ask you another one . 
okay  tell me another one . 
okay  I've got another hard one . 
I know what you mean  the huge one . 
lost one of those laser guns on the front of the Xwing fighter . 
you have a nice one . 
yours is a little one  but it's neat . 
that's a good one . 
which one is yours ? 
I've got a hard one for you . 
I've got a hard one . 
you don't know that one ? 
now  I want to ask you another one . 
he doesn't have one with a round part . 
no  this is a cute one . 
where is one person ? 
what do you mean no one does things ? 
he doesn't have one either ? 
yeah  one of the kids did it . 
do you you think it's a good one ? 
next time you want a better dad just take him back to the hospital and and tell the doctor you want a better one . 
would you like to have one of those for yourself ? 
we're not going to mess this one up . 
okay  one time . 
you can turn it one time . 
one more turn . 
wait  now one more . 
it's hard to move the middle one  Ross . 
okay  now one more . 
the two side pieces came back . 
now  do you want to do a real hard one ? 
you move this one back here . 
and then this one comes back here . 
you're two now . 
okay  Marky's big brother and you're just one ? 
a three legged six armed boo boo ? 
ninety four . 
that is  one that is being made . 
which one ? 
you've got the wrong one there . 
if it came with it  it must be the right one . 
so maybe when they packaged it up for the store they put the wrong one in there . 
maybe the guy who made it made it right  but somebody chose the wrong one . 
what do the five year olds do ? 
the big five year olds do that  right ? 
well  that's one thing you can do . 
you can get the four year olds all organized  okay ? 
get all the four year olds so they can figure out how to get those five year olds to stop it . 
what you need to do is get a bunch of friends and then if those five year olds come by and bother you  you guys can work together and stop them . 
play tricks on the five year olds . 
" you five year olds are going to be the losers . 
the four year olds can petition to have the five year olds removed . 
get all of your kids to figure out a plan against the five year olds  okay ? 
do those those five year olds really have guns ? 
it's this one . 
he's going to be three soon . 
then they'll be four . 
oh  then they'll be four when he's three . 
yes I am four . 
no  you're three . 
no  I'm four . 
well  you're a four year old too . 
yeah  but he's a four year old too . 
was he one of your newer friends at the old preschool ? 
you've got three more field trips . 
one is to the zoo  okay ? 
which one do you like better ? 
in a couple of years when we come here Ross will be six and Marky will be four . 
and now we have a nice new one . 
ya  one of those incidental thoughts . 
can you say two plus three equals five to yourself ? 
when you say that two plus three equals five  then you draw a picture in your mind . 
" two plus three equals five . 
say two plus three equals five . 
equals five . 
three ... 
which one do you you like best ? 
why do you like that one best ? 
you're going to be into five pictures ? 
you're not going to be six years old . 
it's the kids who are either five  or six right ? 
the kids that are four or five now  are going to be fivesix next year . 
you're four  but what are you going to be next year ? 
five . 
the little one ? 
three . 
now these guys are called three  right ? 
so there's one  four groups in all . 
there are four groups . 
kindergarteners are fivesix  and there's three fours . 
he's a three watch ? 
three  here's the big kindergarteners up here . 
there are four groups . 
it is  at the other one . 
okay  and in the other one he was getting in trouble . 
which one was working harder ? 
oh  you mean one that pours down into the living room downstairs ? 
if you have one cookie maybe it'll be good for it now . 
please eat one cookie . 
just one of them . 
 maybe Marky wants one . 
what  read only one book ? 
you still have one question  hunm . 
well then  what happened to the two bad guys ? 
there's no one behind you . 
I'm the one who Marky was sleep . 
which one  the big kids or the little kids ? 
there are two places . 
no  that's enough putty in that one place . 
one of his little friends ? 
you want to see it two times ? 
the whole Empire Strikes Back two times ? 
I'd like to see it two times too . 
three times ? 
which one three times ? 
three times  okay . 
well we've never seen Empire one time yet . 
I saw you and Mommy go one day . 
that's your first one ? 
okay  we'll make another one here . 
out of four crackers okay ? 
should I make one for Marky ? 
which one you gonna take  ?
okay we'll get this one .
it's one you do yourself right ?
it's one that you've used ?
there are  this was it  four boxes four things .
that hurt Dad  that one hurt .

awful lot of boys per one girl . 
we had two girls and two Lukes . 
in other words no one did cutting cutting today . 
I said you mean the four year olds ? 
no  I don't think I have one Superman . 
Mark said I don't think I have one Superman . 
the other one broke at that place where the number hotel was . 
the big long log that the boys sit on and swing off of  the one that is all full of broken pieces of wood . 
because it has to go down  there is one zipper ... 
because the zipper has to go down one leg . 
oh  even the Count one . 
but anyway he has his syntax wrong on that one . 
later today or tomorrow either one  what ever you would like and they're for you guys because you are good . 
now  what was the reason you circled this one ? 
now why did you circle this one here ? 
now you didn't want to say this one was noisy ? 
why is that one not noisy ? 
big wide one  right ? 
yes  always start with one piece that you really know . 
that's the one you're supposed to sit at . 
another one . 
only one more drink . 
not a dirty diaper  a new one . 
yeah  a nine year old . 
one more time .
okay  one minute .
one minute .
^ one minute .
well  this one has guns too . 
so there are three bad things . 
and four ? 
and there's one more of the thing that you did that was wrong . 
five things . 
of those five there is one that we can still fix . 
two of them  you fix one of them right now . 
okay  what about the other one ? 
how do you fix that one ? 
which one ? 
" just my second one . 
" it was my second one . 
" it was just my first and I want one more  but it was my second and I'm finished .

we've talked about when he was three  and things like that . 
because it's a bigger one . 
yeah  but I got an extra one now . 
I've got five  yeah . 
yeah  see if you can gobble one of my guys up . 
try to get one of mine off the board  try to  to zip them off . 
you know a real good idea is to move that one up . 
no  jump over  over this one . 
one of the figures can come out over here too . 
could you read this one ? 
that one is breaking too . 
yeah  okay you want to hear this one ? 
no you can't bring anything  only bring one thing . 
you can only take one toy . 
that means the last one . 
two base ball bats and whatted  them ? 
I think it's one of the best snowmen you have ever done . 
really  a real one ? 
and it's a real crystal shard  a real one . 
is there still two  is there still more sausage  like that sausage ? 
it's a pretty one Mark  do you want me to put up downstairs . 
and I held up the second one . 
how about this one  who did this beautiful one ?

and one for Mommy . 
yeah  one's for Mommy . 
this one for me . 
what was the name of the smart boy one ? 
the first two words are the same  right ? 
no  no one came in . 
because I was real busy  and no one was there . 
five and five make ten . 
oh  the four forgetful bears . 
you're only supposed to have seven . 
so  which one did you want to have happen ? 
some days they would keep as many as thirty seven trucks busy . 
because the boy one has the crystal in the movie  because he has the crystal in his back . 
the one  this one  right ? 
why aren't you  okay  aren't you using the other one ? 
and why does your old school have two slides  Ross ? 
can I have one of this ? 
how do you know which one's Rossy ? 
that one's Rossy ? 
because you and Ross now are saying such nice things together  I think I'm going to put you on the same one . 
we're gonna  we're gonna just have one tape recorder now . 
the Three Little Pigs ? 
two in a word ? 
give me another one Mark . 
what was the other one you told Marky ? 
right  that's a big  those two foaming bricks there .
it's eight o'clock .
Ross  you can put those two paintbrushes in the middle of the paints . 
the big one . 
so if he got hit by one it wouldn't hurt . 
which one do you like best ? 
I like the different one  too . 
the new one . 
I like the new one  too . 
I like the new one and the ... 
I like the new one and the old one . 
well  the old one is traditional . 
but  the new one is fun to play . 
I like the new one . 
yeah Marky likes the new one . 
he's one of the bad kids . 
just one piece of chicken  and then you can have apple juice . 
one jump  two jumps see . 
I'm sad because no one brought me a present . 
are there six more shows . 
five and six more shows ? 
he said there are two more left . 
are there six shows ... 
well  somewhere where no one will will find it . 
and then  don't you need more that one kid to play with ? 
what if no one with play with you ? 
no one at all . 
so cause no one was being being nice to him he should've just left ? 
your mommy's thirty eight . 
no one makes you  and you shouldn't yell . 
the third one ? 
what is the third one  Ross ? 
okay   what are the first two sets of Heman ? 
he's the last one of the first bunch . 
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys  when they sell all of them they come with their numbers . 
but the interesting thing is that Ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found  and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy Barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys . 
no  it makes two infinities and eight . 
one of the guys disappeared just like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz . 
you go one  eight . 
which one is it ? 
but a nice one  huh ? 
I'm the one that ... 
but I'm the one that has glasses .

Laura's gonna help me with one other thing that is really fun to do . 
but it's taller and that one's lower . 
you poured it from one cup to the other . 
even this taller one ? 
I'm gonna fill two glasses . 
which one do you want ? 
why do you think that is if you made the two cups equal ? 
and what's this one  ? 
this one is what ? 
now I'm gonna break my cookie into two pieces . 
the one that I like ? 
now in ten minutes  
point to the gooey one with my eyes closed without looking ? 
I point  that's the gooey one . 
this is the gooey one ? 
you have to stay in  one place if the taperecorder can't hear you . 
there's the number one .
there and then we'll get the number two box .
that was about two hours ago or so and now he remembered the name . 
wrap it around the way to you did on the other one . 
but I haveto finish mine  but I haveto do the whole one and then  too . 
why is he the one who puts the crown on you ? 
a Mommy and a Daddy  and two little boys .

really two surprises for Abe after dinner so why don't you wait and eat dinner with us okay ?
I don't know this one batch isn't .
this is a meal in a dish it has fish and vegatables  all in one .
it's on in about ten minutes .

okay  I'll fix you one .
that's a number six .
it says it is three thirty .
it says it's three thirty .
no  that's the number six .
uhhuh  see the little hand is pointing to the three when the big hand points to the six that means it's half past the hour that's difficult to explain .

I can't take too much blue cheese at one time .

 I'm going to have a peanutbutter apple would anybody like one ?
okay  that's the one with the Billy Goats Gruff and all of those stories in it .
just about three or four more minutes .
I'll be sure to pick the one on the bottom .
I said that I'll turn them on later when it's eight o'clock  okay ?
that's right and when the hands are like this  it's eight o'clock .
maybe you'll get one for Christmas if you ask Santa Claus .

I'm going to cut it in half that way we can have two candles I'll relight it  that works a lot better .
after this one burns down  we'll burn the other one .
I think one fire's plenty  don't you ?
this other one ?
I'm gonna store it in this drawer and we'll use it when this one burns down .

I was gonna bring two rolls  but I don't think you'll pop that many let's go .
I'm going to put all of the money under one of these cups then I'm going to move the cups all around and then I'm going to ask you which cup the money's under okay ?
I'll give you one white .

that's right there were three balls where's the other one ?
oh a baby one .
how could you find one that's as small as a pinhead ?
oh it has one little rip .
this one is different because it only has one block .
but this one is different because it has a colored block and these are all wooden which answer's right ?
I thought you were going to take them out one at a time so you could put them back in .
what's that one ?
I remember the one you made me last year do you remember ?
because it keeps falling apart where's the ax one ?
yeah that's the one you were working on .

look when this long hand gets between the one and the two  that's when we'll eat .
the long hand's pointing between the one and two  and the small hand's pointing to the five it's not ten o'clock but ten minutes have passed and the pizza is done .

no that must have come with one of your animal packages .
we can I've never seen one of those in a zoo though how come I've never seen one of those in a zoo ?
I think so here here's one .
he just lost his balance how come they always have two animals in a zoo instead of just one ?
oh who's a mean one ?
do you have one ?
you were about two years old .
how about this one ?
maybe do you want one ?

Abe  but it was just one of the types of dogs with sharp teeth .

this one ?
let's leave this one on too .
no you already opened it this one how come you opened it ?
five s more than one ?

a dry one or a wet one ?
let me see  yeah they're all on in the right places do you want to do number four now ?

what two things ?
what would happen if one of us gets hurt while we wrestle ?

she showed you one time .
this is one of your tinker toys .
yes  three times you missed .
this one doesn't look like all the others .
yes  but I don't see another one like that .

Adam go look on the bed and bring Paul one of your books .

I only see your name one time .
just use one piece at a time .
have you finished with this one ?
alright  Paul here's one for you .
these are the things that you build with see because they rest on one another .
it seems to me you place these long ones on top of one another .
I guess that one's too small let's put a bigger one on .
you want to put that one on ?
I think this needs to be one higher .
you need two straight pieces .
now we need one more side .
make another one and we'll have a race .

because I teach two classes in the afternoon , baby , and somehow your parties are always , on an eighth period .
they were really being very nice , but their their  sign says personal checks may be made out , to no more than five dollars , ...
, or up to the amount of your groceries , and I have always  gone in there and made out , twenty five dollar checks , ...
I think I'm the first one who gets candy  .
turn that one off .
well , you know the one in his room , it , it , it , you know , it's on almost ...
and now this one , you know , you haveto give it a good turn .
now this one is off .
yeah , I don't mind if you have a lollipop tonight , but one ...

it'll all  lump up in one spot  .

the mother wants one of them to say grace .

he said he'll bring one in .
we'll do it one at a time .
but you're super two  !
up to ten again .

you have , three more minutes .
if , you're supper is not finished in the three minutes you can forget about Doctor Seuss !
because you have two minutes now .
three out of four is not bad  .
I like that one two , but we can't sing it un ...
about , about five more minutes .

" and Sally and I did not know what to do , so we had to shake hands with thing one and thing two .
we shook their two hands but our fish said , n:o , no !
oh I do not like it , not one ".
" we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall .
" thing two and thing one , they ran up , they ran down .
on the string of one kite , we saw mother's new gown .

I think the only one who doesn't want them there is that fish in the pot , kuhz  he's the one that kept saying , tell them to go , and to get that cat in the hat out of here .

and he went out , and he asked her how many there were , and she counted one to one , up to six , and there were six of them .
he removed one , and he asked her how many there were , and she said , I've forgotten whether she counted up to five or whether she just said ".
" five .
I mean , I hadn't sat down and taught her  one , two , three !
and I've quizzed the babysitter , and she hadn't either , so  whether she has real one to one is still questionable , but ...
it's not uncommon for skills to be uneven at her age , so that one time she can do it and not another  it may haveto do with when she initiates and when other people initiate .
and , she substituted that at one point , I think .
my husband would not let me buy her one .
this one was only a buck ninety nine ...
 you asked her at one point , ".

so you know one thing , if you ever are near a fire and it's dangerous , right ?
I'll look at the spaghetti one more ti:me  .
y:eah someone who does something silly and one of the silly things is playing with matches , right .
well I'll tell you one thing .
well one time , when I was out  I was up in Vermont skiing , I was sleeping in a farmhouse and I felt this on my back Julia .
here you wanna slurp one ?
okay a good slurping one .
three pieces of spaghetti is dinner ?
Julia do you think three pieces of spaghetti is dinner ?
thirty five minutes .
can I say one thing ?
you know one of those glass:es , cases .
I'm not gonna feed a big five year old .
so let's  and you can have one of those , lovely cookies you bought for dessert , but you haveto eat the meat .
Daniel , feed Julia one piece for me ?
you'll feed him one pea , and he'll feed you one piece of meat , and see who could finish first .
oh , okay , one pea .
this one ?
you can't be two things at once , can you ?
so it might be one of the new students that you didn't know when you were there .
but there's only one sad thing .
she just had to eat one more , okay ?
let daddy  one pick .
stand up on your own two feet  , you cookie you !
, you know it  one never knows .
one moment , I'm on the phone .
I was walking down the street one day .
while I was walking down the street one ...
well I don't know that one .
he knows that one best .
that means two people singing at one time .
snow white and the seven gahrfz  .
seven dwarfs .
a real one .
not a stuffed one Julie ?
what about a stuffed one ?
he got presents from his two grandmothers .
and he got presents from his two grandfathers .
maybe it's that one .
those are , one of them is for Francaise and Joel , and one of them's for Roseanne , okay ?
and didn't you want eight children ?
so that still makes eight children .
if one person can't come , and we're adding three more that means there's gonna be more , two more , right ?
two extra ones .
two pigs .
" one of the little pigs looked at Emmitt .
look at that one .
they love one another .
I would get all confused if there were two pigs , and one of them was Julia , and one of them was Daniel Murray , when I would call Julia and Daniel Murray the pigs would come instead of the children .
I remember one .
a scary one , right ?
which is the one we said was very , very , scary ?
did we have one other , what are we gonna do ?
it's ten tuh  yet five years old !
I wanna know one thing .
fine  , but no one has to write it down .
and at the end they caught Grape Juice Beard and , Pop Corn Beard was , sailing the seven seas , telling policemen that he was a sword .
kawz  it's on nine o'clocks .
which one first ?
and here's one .
there's another one in the window .
I didn't give him much just one little spot .
there was just one thing to do .
which one did you pick Julia ?
or this is very long story so can I say one thing ?
one day bea  Bambi met the skunk .
one morning Bambi and his mother walked down a path , a new path with vi:nes and bushes .
joy seized him and he leaped into the air three , four , five times .
and pretty soon , early one morning when Bambi was asleep , there  standing up top .
okay and they became very good friends , and they decided to hang around one another .
no we only agreed on one story .
you have one right ?
no Julia has one .
I have pieces of one .

you need to have your own little nut and put it in one  one space .

Aziza , let's give that one another crack . 
well , we'll save that one .

two plus two . 
two plus two is a hundred ? 
one two ... 
one two three ... 
two plus two ... 
two plus two is what ? 
four  ! 
four eggs ! 
I'm thinking of a number between one and five .
one , two , three , four , five .
five .
Aziza , take a guess between one and five .
one , two , three , four , five  .
six !
no , it has to be one , two , three , four , or five .
not higher than five .
four .
okay , Aziza gets it , the number was three .
four is closer to three .
you get to crack two and then Sharifa gets to crack two .
oh , that was a good one .
so the second one was the best one , right ?
that's a good one .
try another one , Sharifa  .
I think you got two whole egg yolks in there !

perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady as he went by . 
and as Paddington reached the check out counter , one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap . 
today , said Mister Brown at breakfast one bright summer morning , feels like the kind of day for taking a young bear to the seaside . 
there was a large bulge on one side , and it was heaving up and down almost as if it were alive . 
there's one puppet called Mister Punch , and when he gets cross all the audience has to boo . 
one way and another Paddington enjoyed his day out at the seaside .

I wonder where did your grandpa live that he had one ?
just a little one .
oh yeah we were talking about that one .
so I wanna see what one of the meat eaters . 
yeah do you wanna bring this one over sweetie ?
that one's a meat eater ?
now which  how come this one's kind of different ?
what does this one do that's kinda  different ?
oh that was the mommy one ?
oh so that way we could pretend that that one's going to eat those eggs .
as this one .
oh my gosh which one might be the mommy one ?
I kinda  like that one .
I like that one too .
this one reminds me of the one in the movie that remember  he's kind of little like a little dog .
do you remember  he kind of looked like that one ?
well this weekend remember we went to stay in a hotel one day  what did we do at the hotel ?
one line okay .
there's only one problem with the big swimming pool though  at the college .
a nice one ?
or maybe one that flies .
you wanna be the one ?
you're the one that does everything ?
aren't I supposed to be the one that catches the money though ?
only two gonna go in there ?
well that one looks like a scary guy .
oh that's just a little baby one .
each one gets a little money ?
yeah so  should he get one then ?
cool so they all got one .
you know to get away from that  mean one .
so it's if they need one then they just haveto ask and then they wait their turn and then they get one ?
what if he says  can I have one I'm a plant eater ?
yeah I want one too .
there is one thing I remember that would happen when you would be with Erin .
yeah you know what that one day  what did daddy let you do with the sweet potato ?
was it a little plastic one ?
one that you use to butter things .
I think we just have four now cause one's lost .
do you have one Matty ?
how many'd you get  just one ?
this one right here I'm trying to get him out .
yeah we can open that one .
I don't know I think that one goes for that guy ?
no no no he's one of the professors  he's one of the teachers .
he's a mean one ?
remember one time I brought some other toys over to play with ?
you remember what Ryan brought you to play with that one day ?
oh so we were watching that one movie .
we also watched  remember the one that was Jurassic Park ?
that's the name of the one movie  right ?
oh that is a cute one .
remember that one that was long .
the one that was long  that was from your classroom .
maybe he doesn't want to tell that story because it was one that he borrowed  and he was not supposed to take it .
so the person who wins is the one who does not hit that guy down right ?
this one .
what letter's this one ?
so where's Percy  that will match that one ?
should we put it aside and do a different one  since we can't find that one ?
so let's see where's are S one ?
you found that one before I did .
oh it doesn't fit in that one .
okay do you know what letter this one is ?
okay  oh you wanna do that one ?
so do you know do you see one of those pictures  where he fell off ?
three  good job .
ten  we're moving along .
now what letter's this one ?
where was that one ?
okay  are we gonna do another one or what's the next step ?
okay what letter's this one ?
three  close .
what's this one ?
it must be one of the trains .
where's one of the trains that has .

so one thing you didn't like it was made out of apple ?
like the kind that we have or a different one ?
do you see the one that has James on it ?
only three  your so small .
alright let's see  we got now which one here ?
he's not a big one .
there you go  you got that one .
yeah he's the one that dropped  remember ?
two times ?
yeah  so actually that is two times .
where was one place we went ?
oh they each haveto have one ?
but what if I get another one  and you can have one and then I can also send one to grandma ?
that's what I was thinkin you can have that one and we can get grandma a new one .
well let's see if this one fits .
you wanna see that one again ?
okay but what if I don't have enough gas to get to that one ?
actually some of them do run on something called kerosene  but this one looks like it runs on batteries .
he looks a little different as the one right there yeah .
they're not the same as that one  but they're all the same as each other .
I have not seen one of those before .
I'm gonna try one then .
I'll take a green one .
well tell him about this one .
okay so Spike is the one they had to go and try to find ?
oh cause I had not seen one of those before .
oh that one kind of scared me a little bit .
oh just a new one okay .
well there's one thing that we could show Ryan that you did get from grandma Sharon and grandpa Dale .
I like this one we like to try and get this one .
this is mommy's cause this one's kind of funny .
that is a good one .
what one ?
now let's look at this last one  and then maybe we can do something different .
oh look at the front of that one .
oh  which one ?

one of my favorites .
I'm gonna pretend that I'm two mices .
you got two .
do you remember one time when we first got your magnets and we walked all around the house and then we tried to see what the magnets would stick to ?
you wanna see if one of your toy cars can do it ?
oh you were just showing Ryan one you were showing him one that had a little dump thing  right ?
so one day Chris came in and said  Vinny anymore .
so that's one thing we're doing what's another thing we're doing  on Saturday night that is with Erica ?
well what was one silly thing that happened when I said it's time for sleep ?
that was a good one .
can I see one more ?
that was a really good one .
oh that's a really long one .
look he says one plus one is what ?
so can you press two ?
and do they have the second one there ?
we'll just do one more and then maybe we'll play a game .
nine minus seven so this is nine  okay .
two again ?
how come it's two again ?
nine  minus seven is two .
oh I think this one .
let's see what one is it ?
let's see this one right here ?
it's the bottom one okay .
is that the right one ?
okay you haveto start right here  and then there's only two people so what'd we do now ?
or is he gonna be this one ?
which one did you just give Ryan ?
a  who's in that one ?
actually you know you're very lucky because when you start here and you hop to one you get to go up here up the ladder .
I got a one too .
oh I got a one too .
now these get tricky because you gotto go in a certain direction  one two three four .
one two  okay so I'm behind you right ?

you're kinda  counting the little actually they're called rungs on the ladder but actually you haveto go this way  so one two three oh no .
no he got here  he got past that one some how ?
you forget which one is Sarah well you told me it was Ricky .
well one thing I'll give you a little hint it's something that was kind of silly because we can eat it too  for breakfast .
ten ?
three right now .
so then you're gonna be six  right ?
oh just four  yep .
and you think that only one really should come ?
well if you only gotto invite one friend what would you do ?
one weekend we went to a party and they were showing the Thomas movie and then we went to somebody's house for dinner and they were showing the Thomas movie .
so there's a mean one named Diesel and he wants to blow up all the trains .
have you ever seen a train before  a real one ?
we heard one once .
I remember that one time you screamed really loud and this lady screamed cause you scared her .
like one of these two maybe ?
so I wonder if this one might be a good one for a leg  let's see .
how about that one  can that one work ?
now where does this one go you think ?
who's the only one that probably knows that you're ripping that up ?
and Jesus  but grandpa Dale is not one of those people right ?
yeah it wasn't just a space shuttle it had seven people in it .
two dollars ?
how  this this will be my two dollars ?
I think yep  I think it goes through this one .
it was the first one ?
it's not the first one ?
and it showed that it was the first one instead of the third one .
and you thought it was the third one ?
one dollar  okay .
here's my one dollar .
I'm trying to think about one of the things you got  remember you got a little thing in the car that was so interesting .
or is one the mommy and the other one is the daddy ?
let's say this one was crying now this little boy .
two little doggies were going at a time ?
I still gotta choose an animal if I want one ?
one dollar for the dog ?
okay here you go here's the one dollar .
two dollars ?
how come only one ?
I wanna see all your dogs and choose the one I like the best .
I only get to choose one ?
but other people might want one oh .
well alright alright I'll take this one .
I'll choose this one he seems very nice .
what's this one's name ?
I would like the brown one please .
two dollars ?
I don't have two dollars .
he's one dollar ?
okay I got one dollar .
who's gonna be the one who buys ?
no this one  that little one .
yes you used to have one .
we built a new one  build a new one .
what happened to the old one that was shaped like a turtle ?
oh yeah  the baby needed one and we were moving .
yeah  this one's really hard .
well one is from a movie called .
so how do you  if I just go there will they give me one then ?
this is one of the times you want to say all of it ?
this one's name is  let's see what would their names be ?
more than seven  a thousand .
we've been watching that one .
and then do we have one that could be Sara ?
and now who is this one ?
so if you could be one dinosaur what one would you be ?
we probably haveto kind of stay in one spot .
you're gonna sacrifice one of your friends ?
now which one do I get to eat ?
who gets eaten in the Land Before Time number one ?
alright I'm set  two Harry Potter guys .
one buck  okay .
ten ?
so I get one of those back ?
one buck thank you  okay .
a turkey  if you get three in a row that's right .
wow that one's a pretty tricky one to get down .
remember we rented that movie and you watched it like five times ?
yeah we watched Charlotte's Web  that's the second one .
but that one keeps falling down ?
alright  and how about the last one .
so I'll tell him about one of them  I'll tell him about the scariest one and you tell him about a different one okay ?
one of them has ...
oh  you wanna tell him about one first ?
that's the scariest one I was thinking of .
and there's one where their heads are almost gonna crash .
and then  what's another one that they have ?
yeah  that one was very interesting .
do I remember the one that's next to the tyrannosaurus rex ?
was he the one that looked kind of like a ankliasaurus ?
you know  I remember one time when you dressed up as a mummy .
oh I know one time something we did that Ryan did not know about .
it just shows one person .
I think this is just the one .
oh right here it shows two girls  I see .
yeah  so there's more blocks and then there's two people .
let me see  is he a nice one ?
what does that one eat ?
if I don't have enough room would you be able to take one home and let him live at your house ?
I think that I might want to buy one too  which one ?
which one would be good for my house ?
this one or this one ?
so does he get that one for free  or does Ryan haveto pay for that last one ?
oh I want that one .
maybe I could ask Ryan if I could have one of his cause he has lots of trees .
but only one .
what if this one tries to fly away though ?
alright Ernie  you got one more chance .
get another one ?
the new one ?
I don't know  it does looks quit a bit like one .
well I'm trying to think about another things that's gonna  be happening in a day or two .
it's very old old wires and we noticed so we took it apart  so we got a new one .
you have one of these  look look look !
like a pretend one or a real one ?
two to six years cause how old are you now ?
three to seven years old  that seems like something you would like huh ?
this one is a mystery though  what is this supposed to be ?
well what's one part that's scary ?
you can open one more of those and then we actually gotta go home because remember  we're gonna go visit our new land .
you're gonna try to open those two ?
here's one  okay . 
that one's just empty ?
you got this one  okay .
and here's this one wow .
is that the last one ?
okay , so which one should we start with ?
it says recommended for children over three years of age .
this is the one we weren't sure of last time remember ?
how will we get this one open ?
the other time we forgot this one  what's in that one ?
so the last time we forgot that one huh ?
oh yeah  what kind of a loud one ?
how come this one comes out and the other one doesn't ?
one .
one toaster .
I have one in my house too .
three cookbooks .
do you remember  what's one of the names of one of the books ?
cats have ants  and remember the other one ?
do you know which one is your favorite one ?
I'll try to think of which one I like best .
should they have two fridges at their house ?
what's wrong with that one ?
one time you sunk under the water ?
I think though that this might be the last one that we should take apart okay ?
so which one is the last one ?
okay  that's the last one .
well the toilet is in the other one .
oh I think I already put the couch in  I think that was one I already put away .
two .
there's three in there ?
does it fit in that one maybe ?
one thing that was  two things .
here's one box for one of em .
so what happens when you turn four ?
what else happens when you're four  where might we go ?
okay one .
four ?
it says four balls fall .
one two three four five ?
that's a six  yeah .
six sick bricks .
six .
one two three four five six .
okay  where's your seven ?
whoa  it says seven humps on the bump of gump .
that's what it says  seven humps .
one two three four five six seven .
no  there really is seven on the bump of gump .
eight mice eat nice rice .
what comes after eight ?
yeah  where's nine ?
nine oh nine  we miss you so much nine .
oh it's gonna be  oh that's the six .
remember the six and the nine are upside down from each other so this is the six with the big tummy and nine has the big head .
here's your nine .
nine wet pets .
the eight  right ?
should we do ten ?
it says ten teeny tiny teeth .
what comes after ten ?
ten  what comes after ten ?
remember two ones next to each other are the elevens .
mhm  two ones .
where do you see two ones next to each other ?
you silly one .
ten  so he's got eleven .
he's got an extra one .
ten eleven .
twelve is the one and a two next to each other .
so  we're gonna see Ryan one more time okay .
I think we have three boxes we haven't opened yet okay .
do you remember if you have one or not ?
you actually do have one but  it's too small .
since Ryan is moving she's gonna be the one that she's gonna come  we're gonna meet her here instead .
I know one thing I bet she would think is interesting .
so sometimes he goes behind that one  yep .
he might be thinking you were gonna be four and he might be wondering if you're gonna have a birthday party .
do you know who this one is ?
but that one is not huge like in Harry Potter .
how big is the one at your school ?
there's that one .
oh , I like that one .
one .
one .
just one more day .
I know somebody who went into one of those chest things .
we don't really have ours  this one is actually like a little seat .
that was nice they let you make a new one .
I wonder if our other one is at home .
that other one .
yeah , we'll have two now .
you silly one .
well  maybe we'll haveto think of one more story to tell Ryan before we go .
that would be like one of our cats .
it only took you two balls to get them all down .
yeah  you got all of them except that one .
alright so it took three times that time .
one day we went to the beach  do you remember ?
so if there's only two more or one more left hit left you're gonna  hit it down with one of these ?
two more .
wow that was a wild one .
I'll haveto use one of these though in order to set them all up again .
there's four left .
you want to knock it down with that one ?
that one doesn't get put up .
can you hand me those two Matty ?
there is actually only one two three four  there's only supposed to be ten .
these two are never filled up these are empty .
there's only supposed to be ten .
so this one you have in your hand goes actually right here .
I think we should play a different game after this one .
whoa  that was an interesting one .
do remember one time that Mommy and Daddy got in a car accident ?
so Roman got two and you got one right ?
and then what did that one guy give you guys  that was interesting .
did it look the same as the one the guy gave you yesterday ?
it might have been the same same one .
two toes ?
you can lift up this one part of the track .
all in this one little mass .
yet another one !
ten dollars .
I owe you fifty  ten .
a dollar ten is that how much it costs ?
number eight won't ring up  let's see if the rest do .
we're only going to be here about five more minutes .
this one's funny it's called Aunt Fanny's Cookbook .
put one in here ?
I thought maybe we'd go sow Daddy that waterfall  the big one .
you take one of the sticks and hit it down ?
could you please hand me those two ?
okay one more time .
two what ?
two more times ?
okay two more and then that will be it .
one more time .
hit them all over one more time .
what do they call that when you get three strikes in a row ?
if you get three strikes in a row that's what it's called .
okay  last one .
how come you didn't go on that one ?
let's ride the motorcycle because we've rode one before .
okay one more time and then we'll do something else .
two noodles and a hotdog ?
only two noodles that's all ?
one kooky poop ?
did Daddy make you a new hotdog or did you eat the one I made you yesterday ?
he didn't know I made one did he ?
forty two things  and what else ?
I see  so some of them are a mix of colors and some of them are the one plain color .
it's Jurassic Park three .
so he almost got two goals on Monday .
do you think I could have one of those slinkies for my office ?
do I get to chose one or do you chose one for me ?
I just like having one  so it doesn't matter what color it is really .
did you give one to Daddy yet ?
well I know one thing you did that you got stickers for this week .
you just got a new one again today huh ?
wow so is one like the Mommy cactus and one's like the baby cactus ?
is it prickly like the one that is in your room already ?
ye is it prickly like the other one is ?
I really don't have one .
the one that is missing that I think he ate ?
okay let's say I came in and I liked my pet so I want a new one .
excuse me  do you have any more spinetails just like this one ?
no one's even used them  how fun .
I liked that one part that had the lobster bowl .
this one actually looks like it's lookin pretty good .
this one  you can mush that one .
that one too  so those are ones that we can't use .
so that  that red one looks like that could be pretty decent .
so we found starfish member there was one that was yellow and one that was red ?
this one's a really good one too .
I think it is Aladar  it's the same one .
well  but what is this little one holding ?
ten or six minutes .
alright I'm gonna buy  this one and this one .
okay  one dollar .
how bout four ?
one for each thing  four bucks .
I want these two .
I think this will work pretty well for the two .
I think I'll take the two dogs .
I'll take the two dogs so they each have their own little pet .
alright well  I'd like to learn about this one .
can you tell me about this one  what would he be like ?
he's like the first one  okay ?
yes are you the one who sold me this dinosaur ?
one dollar  for all of these ?
I'm a little worried about this one .
well this one doesn't want to live here though cause there is a volcano erupting .
this one here has been crying .
you just have one big one  one flashlight ?
well I need like three or four  three or four batteries should do it .
how about a T rex  he's the first one in line .
I'll just remember one more thing  and then we'll play the game .
alright  which one shall I choose ?
the clue is , three or four pieces .
that was kinda  funny about the party  three or four pieces of what ?
the game  yup , there was three or four pieces of the game you had to collect , right ?
I was thinking about three or four pieces of  cake .
one dollar okay .
guess you can have another one ?
well you didn't really beg for one , but you said you wanted one but she asked you , she said  and what did you say ?
she gave you one anyway , right ?
what did you haveto do at school with like the big A and little a  do you remember that one picture ?
okay  number two ?
okay  which one do you like next after that ?
your very favorite is the one that goes down okay .
that one , the light pink ?
we each have three  is that how many you have ?
oh one two three four , one two three four  how many do you have in your hand ?
and I have three  so the reason we don't have the exact same number is because we have mister broken one here .
three different colors , and see how that comes out ?
oh mostly orange  you actually had all four colors , but how come you only mostly see the orange ?
all of them  I got seven of them .
yes you do  I only have seven .
it's kind of hard to draw with more than one isn't it ?
the only one you really can't see very well is the light pink  you don't see light pink really .
oops  okay , that one already had a broken but we don't any other ones to break .
alright  I think I will buy this one he seems gentle .
these two  how come those two ?
well , if I only have room for one , which one shall I choose ?
ye did they color this one the same ?
mhm  that one's kinda  green here , and blue here , right ?
three one  thirty one ?
thirty one cents ?
okay  that's my thirty one cents .
thirty one ?
the water one well I'll buy that one .
okay  whenever he sees one of his friends he goes over to it .
how shall I choose which one gets to go home with him ?
hello  are you the one that sold me all these dinosaurs ?
well , I haveto tell you  one of them , the pterodactyl , I think he's very sick .
I don't know if she knows that one place we went where there were tons of  very big ...
Daddy catched one , yeh .
two snails and one worm but ...
picking up five ducks  what were the ducks ?
five ducks , and then you won a whole bunch of little toys , like a little harmonica .
you can't tell yet  okay , how about if I count to ten and maybe you tell ?
well , there was one time we went hiking and we found something that was very tasty  and you ate them all what were those ?
we didn't even start the grape one yet , right ?
I use to like the grape one  it's like a raspberry apple .
you were Elmo when you were two .
you were Elmo when you were two , and then last year you were a ...
oh , the cherry one .
one's like a dad , and one's like a grandpa .
I'm not the one who was there when you got it .
so that one's a rectangle and this is a square , so it's not fitting in , is that the problem ?
it's one dollar  for all of this , or for each dinosaur ?
which one is the smartest one that I should teach ?
okay , so one dollar , here you go .
listen , I decided to separate them  so I put all the plant eaters in one place , and all the meat eaters in another place .
one of em is lost .
well I thought that there was like a purple one , are there any purple dinosaurs ?
maybe he was just hiding in the bushes at one point , right ?
what time is it  it's about three thirty .
no it is about three thirty  see it is three thirty in the afternoon .
it's two thirty in the morning ?
it's two thirty  I'm back to see you again .
okay now , who's the one's that are fighting ?
these two didn't ?
three things  they can choose whatever they feel like , kinda  like the prize draw ?
one minute , okay .
so they gotta come really one at a time .
and we know these two don't fight , so they can come up together , right ?
well , I was wondering if this one needs to have a friend ?
I think  I'll take that one .
cause I bought the other one , this guy's free ?
look at that , he does not seem happy that the darker one was putting him in his mouth .
it's not his baby  it's just a little one ?
so , ohmygoodness , it's a funny one , isn't it ?
ten James .
alright , so I only really had to pay one dollar for just the one and all the rest are free ?
zero dollars ?
zero dollars  each ringing them up .
but each one only costs like zero cents , right ?
right on one of the animals  like on one of these animals ?
well , I just don't know which ones are meat eaters , and which one's are plant eaters .
which one is this , plant eater , right ?
oh , that's the one we've ran out of ?
we got some dvds that each have like ten episodes , right Boo ?
so , I have a question  you were telling me about his one kid at your school , what's his name ?
the one who always gets the yellow sticks .
this one  this meat eater .
the mayor , the one who's in charge of the town ?
how about these particular one , would they want these kinds , you think ?
one time he bit Mckayla ?
well just say one part of it  what is interesting .
I don't want to buy five lizards , just one .
oh wait , no  not two , not three !
not so many lizards  just one !
one , oh  one actually starts with an o .
one what ?
one penny ?
one dollar .
is it one dollar for all nineteen lizards or one dollar for each lizard ?
thirty two dollars and forty one cents for all these groceries ?
what do you need with that one ?
you're the one who told me he was real .
yeah , two of the got blowed over , totally .
ten days from now , hm .
yeah  you guys might go to that one instead .
do you wanna see if this one works ?
alright , I'll let you do it one more time and then we'll do something else for a while .
not your two Grandmas  Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale are coming .
oh , there's an aquarium by Niagara Falls  that's a little one though .
they went to Lion Country Safaris one time .
one time in the summer I remember you and I went to the Lake Erie state park , and it was super hot , and we dumped water on our heads .
well you just asked him for that one thing .
oh cause you've been actually playing this one game all the time at home .
it's a hundred , when you get to one hundred , you win .
do you remember , what did Roman , you have for his birthday party when he turned four ?
I think , I think when he turned four , remember he had just you there for his party , and he just had , and he had Spiderman , you guys got a couple little Spiderman ?
oh look , she found another one  another one .
well , is there any one particular one that you would recommend ?
and then five , right , is he a dinosaur ?
we haven't watched this one in a while , it's from Lion King .
ten .
ten , yes .
what's that one about ?
five days .
well , we are actually leaving for Grandma Sharon and Grandpa Dale in  three days .
we love that one .
one kid , member , he tried to have too much chocolate , what happened to him ?
what happened to that one girl that was very spoiled ?
so , anyway , yeah , so that's one of the gifts that I got you remember ?
so he was like , “well that will give us  three days , one day to go to Sears Towers” right , “one day to go to the dinosaur museum” , and what was the other place you wanted to go ?
aquarium , but we decided we probably will only go to Chicago one , one day .
in one day .
okay , and then tell me which one truly is your favorite .
which one do you eat more ?
I just was thinking , it might actually be two years since you've seen Jaden .
why don't you try one more time ?
Walmart  for eight year old kids ?
well you actually got one microscope and you got a couple of magnifying glasses too .
two microscopes , did Gran , did Grandpa Zevenburgen , wasn't that a little microscope too , right ?

can I put that one in hum ?
so that was interesting thing that happened , he didn't go to school though for two weeks .

only three  three big splatters .
and then some other stuff too  this is like a little kind of a little splatter one .

I do not like one this so well , I do not like this one so well , all he does is yell , yell , yell .

here's three of them .
are there three of them ?
just take , just two strings , easy .
can you do it with just two strings ?
can you do another one on the other side ?
and then take two strings .
then I put that one around .
and around and this one around , and around , and I make a knot .
and now you have one .
because you gave me one .
but but that's just a drawing picture one .
and the wheels meet two of them , three of them , four , because it's a long , bumpy .
we're just doing it in one big place .
and they make big piles of six , so no one can get crossed off .

I was the one who said last June , after all .
" I want one more jump .
when I was ten years old , I had a cousin that I goaded into jumping and she broke her elbow right straight through .
I may let her sleep on the , is that one of the peaches that I bought ?

it's only eight fifteen .
oh , seven forty .
the combination of your two things .
and she says , Ralph you go along and I'll stay home for three days .
and as soon as they get out of sight , she's rolling on the floor laughing , saying three whole days to myself .
I got such a bang out of three whole days by myself .
did you get that one ?
the theme looked like a good one and I picked it up and brought it home and it was awfully good .
she had been an extremely successful author and she died at the age of seventy two .
it was a series of stories in one book .
I don't like those either but that one I did .
well , he's seventy two years old .
we've learned how to pick one out .
the second one .
this one or the one last year ?
I like them both the same , but I really like the one last year because it was big .
and no masses in the middle , just one big place to swim around .
and you could dive in the other one .
I like this one because we were the only ones there .
and there were only two other people , three other people , all men besides us there last year .
that's the one I'm talking about .
we play it you get one point for the closest person .
but the one who owns Angie did not leave yet .
besides when she's ten years , I told her she could do as Dana does .
I want about this much cut because I hate it when it always goes to one side or the other and I hate that .

one braid , yuck .
one braid in the back .
look , your bowl is there and there are two boxes of cereal in the corner in the kitchen .
I know , but you might just want to give me one and have you have one so we could have a little war going on .
then you're going to have fun having a war without two people .
I'll give her one of each color .
I have two prescriptions I would like you to refill , please .

it was one of those great sorrows of grandmother's life .

middle age begins at fifty five .

Sam was born in nineteen forty four .
Renee was born in nineteen forty four .
nowadays , more and more women are having their first child at the age of thirty five .
I think that if they do this amniocentesis , women over thirty five , if there's real reason to believe that they might have problems .
I think a normal woman at thirty five having her first child , they don't do it with .
but it certainly is marvelous for people having their first child after forty or having their first child with a complicated medical history after thirty five , to know that your child is not going to have any defects .
he is , god knows , thirty nine .
she is thirty eight .
archie comic books are the kind of reading that ten year olds like .

Jenny you pick the one you want .
keep in mind that two of them are going to Dana .
why are you giving her that one ?
there are exactly six left in the can , which means four for Jinky and two for Dana .
the one in Kansascity ?
no the wonderful one in Syracuse .
remember , the one in Kansascity fell down last year .
wasn't that the one where you walked in and it was so warm ?
no , no we're talking about when we've gone swimming there that one time in the summer .
one thing that kept you , though , Jinky , is what they did is they kept you in the water when you had just learned to swim .
you're now at the stage where someone could really teach you how to do a pretty one .

her mother decided to to let her play baseball with her friends at the park for three hours .
you are not done; you've got one more thing .
I forgot to grade these two .
I've got two more things left .

it's better than one hundred ninety eight .
well , no , his combined average is now about two twenty .
the first half , it was one ninety eight .
he's the one who made two , two , wait , let me say it , two triples and a home run .
do you that Reggie picked up on Friday night out there in front of us over thirty one dollars and put it in his pocket .
oh no , and then he got something like twelve dollars the next night but on Sunday he had been getting so many hits , he got a home run on Saturday , he had been getting so many hits they only threw him one dollar .
why did they only throw him one dollar .
I want that one .

I have one and a half cups of , black eyed beans here .

that's it , just one . 
you think there are nine ? 
six to eight cups of . 
seven to nine minutes for this .
four two eight six nine three three .
I'm not exactly sure of the time , but , uh , probably like three: ...
uh , threethirty or four . 
I think it needs one more minute . 
there've only been about  five or ten minutes that've elapsed . 
Mommy's one on the desk there . 
she's the one who gave you the new  toothbrush . 
after recording , hang up or press one for more options . 
that was about three weeks ago . 
there are two other cars in line . 
there were two flags up there .

oh , that must be a good one . 
and we saw one species tulip out the window . 
mmmm that's one of the sitters ? 
you did help put together your bed , all three of us helped to put it together . 
there's two there .

I remember the little one's name . 
I don't remember the big one's name .

allright , let's put this one back ... 
use two hands . 
I'll get it for you in just a minute , I haveto make one phone call .
one is pink and there's a red one , coming in . 
I was thinking maybe we should all go , for at least one meal we should go to like to the paddock or something . 
you think one of these is enough for , all of us ? 
there's twenty one ... 
twentyone grams of protein in this whole thing that's not enough for four adults really . 
three plus fifteen ... 
right , he'll he'll have maybe four or five grams , the rest of us will , have more . 
now put it on the sofa with the next one .
see that other one ? 
Naima tore one of her cards . 
well this one seems , to fight . 
I think it was one of these things where they were right on top , they were , you know .
I will have one that you haven't been squeezing .
that would be one way he would know . 
early spring , one to two weeks before last frost so really they should , be ...
two to three foot tall , that's really tall for bachelor'sbuttons . 
no , three feet is common . 
two to three .
I think there were three , two or three wiggly things . 
wiggly wiggly wiggly you were going back and forth from one to the other . 
okay I'll put it on that one . 
it's like three meals a day for , four people is , like constant cooking and cleaning up . 
hold onto the jar with one hand and then put the knife in .
and one second , as soon as ...
it's a real one ?
still recording on this one ?
Sally will use the green one ? 
oh , take a turn with the green one .
Loley Worm looks like he's carrying , a teapot a cup a saucer a mug and two more teacups .

five , fat . 
whoops , not that one . 
there's one , there's one .

I've never seen one , I think the birds just poop wherever they are . 
all three of us were there . 
you think it was a new one ? 
a:nd talk about the reasons we're gonna do things one way or the other . 
you just have one right there right now . 
you can use this one . 
but I have two to make .
building , from one building to another . 
Mommy still has two bites of frenchtoast to eat . 
four months ...
no , twentyfour months plus four ...
you could draw on that one . 
I think that's the other part why don't you give that one to me . 
hmmm , there that one's fixed . 
one at a time , one at a time it's easier . 
this is tricky , you gotta hold that with one hand . 
the green one is in your hair .

and one would be do ducks , what do ducks eat ? 
two , two ... 
I'd take two or three bunches , I mean it depends on how many you wanna get rid of . 
I think actually like two smaller bunches would be better than one big bunch . 
I'll take maybe just four leaves of that . 
of July , two thousand and three ...
three days late recording .
batteries in the receiver and one of the transmitters . 
well bears don't eat gasoline for one thing .
twenty four minutes , I guess that's better than nothing , for now . 
what is the name of this one ? 
was there just one or was there a mommy and a baby ? 
yeah , if you put all four wheels down it'll be easier to push . 
there , it rolls , if you keep all four wheels down it'll roll easier . 
why don't you put one of them here . 
one of them here .
did she read the bear snores one once she has that book .

shut your eyes and say one two three .
but the cat is looking this way so the cat sees the mother bear and that cat wants to help mother bear surprise baby bear that's why he says don't eat just yet shut your eyes and say one two three .

one , two , three . 
the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood . 
don't touch either one . 
you know you could get down and find one and bring it back to them . 
you could get down and go  over where your books are and pick one out for them . 
I know I know which one are you pointing to ? 
you're right three . 
twelvth today is August twelvth two thousand and three . 
I bet they like that one . 
one two three four five six seven eight there're eight eggs in the nest . 
hah and pretty soon they hatch and they have eight chicks . 
it's past two o'clock . 
here get that one out okay .
use two hands for that . 
oops that was just two seconds off by accident there . 
ahh forty three minutes okay .

and then the other one . 
oh , just one , huh ? 
oh boy , I like that one allright . 
Mommy is the one who wears nursing shirts .
I think he was supposed to fix it so that it would say Mama again , two hands please . 
you can cut one piece and then I want you to eat it . 
it's just it's more interesting and more broken up but you know , if you go by ferry , I mean if it's say fifteen minutes for the ferry , each ferry that's half an hour of a wait plus each one is about twentyfive minutes , that's an hour and a half plus the drive time , so ... 
not that it'll be very spectacular , that is really one of , the Eastport to Deer Island ferry is just one of those local ferries .
oh , that one . 
yeah , you could put that one up there . 
how about if we made one that was a little more stable and it wouldn't fall down as easily ? 
you could put it right on top of that one  actually .
was it after nine eleven ? 
well for instance here's a sleeps ten ... 
six bathrooms ... 
four king beds ... 
yeah , well this is one of 'em  . 
you can get sleeps eight , sleeps ten ...
because things are more stable if they're not on just one lego . 
and you're doing a good job by holding onto it with one hand , that also helps . 
two more mornings here I wouldn't really be in favor of buying a whole maple syrup just for that 'cause  I don't want to haveto carry back a lot of ...
and there's  one , um ... 
just one end ? 
that was just one kiwi and you ate it .

just like you're two and a half years old . 
I read this book two and a half times . 
didn't you bring one home ?
then he dropped two: in at once and leaned over the bridge to see which of them would come out first . 
and one of them did . 
but as they were both the same size , Pooh didn't know if it was the one he wanted to win , or the other one . 
so the next time he dropped in one big one and one little one . 
the big one came out first . 
and the little one came out last , which was what he had said it would do .

I leave this there I bet Sleepy would like that one . 
what was this one ? 
every one at school wanted  it but it was mine . 
I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my . 
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said .

and that's the littlest one that I see . 
yes that's the medium sized one .
I'm eight years old and my best friend look at all the necklaces she's wearing . 
I'm eight years old and my best friend is a chicken . 
you may laugh at that but when I tell my friend secret she can talk all she wants but no one can understand her except another chicken of course my chicken not only listens to my stories she has other uses if you play with her and take her mind off of what's going on you can quickly very quickly snatch a feather or two when she's distracted she doesn't notice and feathers come in handy later of course . 
I have two hopes one is my name Tondie which means hope in my language . 
you haveto pick one of those . 
that's good one except here's this one with the small t that has a capital T . 
one two three you count the words .
the one six seven but the period is not actually a word .
one two three four five six seven .

the giraffe had four long long legs .
I wonder if Motorcycle Chicken would like the tale of two bad mice . 
this one is big and little .
you want me to read this one ?
is there another page to that one ?
should we read the next one ?
the tale of two bad mice .
it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane . 
there were two red lobsters and a ham . 
there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet . 
and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box . 
there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs , all so convenient . 
is she too little or has she been to one ?
that's a number four . 
four . 
yes there are four children wai:ting for buse:s .
mmmmhmmm , five children are on bicycles . 
no the answer to the question is there are two police officers . 
right , there are three street cleaners . 
one , two , three , four , five ...
six .
one is driving .
number seven is driving . 
nine .
that one's getting messy . 
and close my eyes for two minutes . 
which one ?
let me see , which one is that ?
which one ? 
point again to which one you want .
it is ten past four . 
which means it's really ten past five in the old time . 
are you gonna draw another one ?
you were right , Naima , there are six .
can you draw two squares ? 
oh , you got that one out ?
you don't wanna make one ? 
there's a small one , a bigger one , and then there's the biggest one of them all . 
and in this one ... 
you know , I think that when we go to the library next we'll get one of the other Little Bear books out too .
d'you  remember that one ?
once there were two bears , Big Bear and Little Bear . 
well , I don't think you can have the transmitter because I think the transmitter's  gonna stop working if we drop it one more time . 
two , three , le me see , two: . 
one , two , three , four , five .
one more page . 
which one do you wanna look at , you wanna look at the dinosaur sticker book or the magnetic beach or the magnetic ...
four ? 
one ... 
two ... 
three . 
right , there are two dolphins jumping out of the water . 
that was one time when we were at Craigville beach . 
this one ?
around all four sides . 
one , two , three , four . 
they're going to build four walls . 
one along this edge . 
one along this edge ... 
one along this edge ... 
and one along this edge and then it will be a building . 
a regular building usually has four  walls . 
the one in the living room you were talking about ? 
or is that a different one ? 
where's the one who looks like Naima ?
allright well I don't see the fire truck , that one is missing .
because I haven't found that one . 
that's the word one . 
the number one . 
that goes on the wo:rd one . 
and the  when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon . 
one . 
that's actually two words , pumpkin pies . 
but there's only one sticker , do you see a picture of pumpkin pies ?
yes , one was taken to the ... 
one was taken to the school . 
one by one they burst . 
when he got home , he still had one beautiful red balloon . 
and one was all he needed . 
one in .
he's the one who knows why . 
that one with the blue . 
that one right there ?
he uses that one when he cooks ?
I don't know if we're looking at the same one , but I see one right by the fence here . 
are you looking at a different one ? 
oh no , it's the same one .
do I just come come at nine and then just ... 
it won't be three hours but ...
one sec and I'll write it down .
actually: I don't see one yet . 
that one I'm not sure .
let's  put all the nuts in one container and save them .
you could make two of those musical instruments . 
you wanna put the other nuts in the other one ?
are you making one or two of these ? 
that one will sound empty I bet . 
let's  put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like . 
one , two , three .
cause  I just had four sticks of butter , and now suddenly I only have three .
I'm gonna count to ten , then you're gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor . 
there's one there .
let me see if I can find one . 
my little one . 
okay I'll read this one . 
well I mean one that wouldn't be too big . 
we wouldn't want one that would be .
that would cover up more than one number . 
which potty do you think we should take with us on the journey , should we take this potty seat and leave these two at home ? 
this one ? 
do you wanna use this one ?
this one ? 
this one , dreamer ? 
you're gonna be there for two nights . 
let's see: if I heat up a pancake three times , will it actually turn into rubber ? 
oh that's a good one . 
that's the purple one .
there's only one more with ... 
in here , it's the pink one . 
one on each side ? 
kay  , there's one piece that you left there . 
seven  thirty . 
just one ? 
not two ? 
and fit , yeah , that's a good one . 
full , oh that was a great one when Daddy said that . 
people use to  take animals from one place to another . 
oh you know what this one is broken it doesn't work . 
and this one is also broken and doesn't work at all . 
this one works , pull that one down . 
give me a hint or do you want me to give you another one ? 
do you want me to give you another one ?
hmmm , it has two words in its name . 
this is gonna be a hard one . 
it has two words in its name . 
and , it has four legs . 
oh , one train did not wanna go that way and switched to go that way instead ? 
who are Salty's friends , this one is Duncan isn't it . 
have  five minutes before you're gonna brush your teeth Naima . 
it's past seven thirty .
two ... 
three ... 
four . 
this is one big sticker , look at that . 
let's see if we can put that really big one on . 
line one . 
line one . 
Naima it's way past seven thirty . 
you know it's just that it's time , we always brush around seven thirty ... 
it is seven thirty .
not this one . 
that one . 
oh we got this one out of the library too , this says ... 
Ruby read the story six times . 
do you remember that one ?
don't you wanna pick out two books . 
two books to read ? 
you fold one end up and then the next end . 
here's another one . 
there's one triangle . 
one here ... 
this is the inside that no one's gonna see .
take this in one hand . 
I'm holding this one down . 
and I'll put a piece there and I think we need one more little piece . 
would you put that one over there ? 
and I'll put one here . 
right on the edge and I'll put one little piece right here too . 
one for your picture .
the one behind you is the one you wrapped .
you have two pieces , one for each si:de . 
what I mean is one for each edge . 
here's the other one .
and this one too . 
we:ll since there are five different tastes .
actually six . 
I'm aware of that one too but ... 
have various ideas about what the opposite is or whether it has one .
well after three cookies it's sort of ... 
fold this one do:wn . 
there's a box of tissues right there if you need one .
you just need one . 
jammed is a good one .
one da:y , a child , walked and walked and walked and walked . 
if I bring one out , can you put it on by yourself do you think ?
seven fifteen . 
do you want to try one ? 
either this one or your table . 
you can be his mommy now and take him to Four Seas . 
or take him to J P Licks that's the one in Brookline that we liked , remember ?
that's also a nice one . 
good five oh three . 
no , this one is the one I'm going to give you today . 
yeah , you know how to use that one .
four twenty ? 
the one you said I should write timiam on . 
then when your done with that one .
oh , you all finished with that one ?
you could make her one , too . 
this is one reason why the floor should be clean . 
well , you know what , you may have three pieces of ice to play with .
here's another one of your pieces . 
the black is the one that says for Daddy , I see .
that's allright , I called them right at five , and she told me what was on the regular menu , but  she didn't have the specials yet .
I've got one in my pocket too .
well it's one of those things . 
is that the one you're thinking of ?
um my little girl has a green one just like this and she also has one in the shape of an elephant . 
that's uh going to be five dollars . 
so that makes five ... 
six ... 
seven dollars is what you owe me . 
oh it looks like you're buying two cups that are a dollar each . 
and you're also buying the magnadoodle which is five dollars . 
so that's seven dollars that you owe me . 
five ... 
six ... 
seven . 
do you have seven dollars ? 
oh do you think you have seven in there ? 
well why don't you give me a couple of those and we'll pretend it's seven dollars .
unless you'd like me to make you  seven dollars . 
see there's five dollar bills and one dollar bills here . 
there's no such thing as a seven dollar bill . 
to make seven dollars you haveto take  a five dollar bill and two one dollar bills . 
and that makes seven .
they did give me a shock every time I tried to put one on and that's very strange and ...
he's five years old ? 
are they five too ? 
she's six years old . 
oh we're two teachers .
three years old ?
that dinosaur will turn three in March ? 
not that one ? 
one two ...
eleven children and two teachers . 
who else can count up to eight ? 
do any of these other children know how to count to eight ? 
okay I guess we need to write the number eight on something then . 
where is the seven that we had ? 
oh the seven's up there . 
let's turn it over and write eight on the back . 
oh we could hide that eight .
we could hide the number eight that's blue next to that seven . 
okay can you get the seven down ?
the seven on the brown paper on the whiteboard ? 
that seven . 
I will write eight on the back . 
and then we'll hide the eight  Cotuit Nursery School . 
shall I draw an eight ? 
dyou  wanna write the eight ?
draw a funny eight . 
here is an eight . 
tha's not the eight down there . 
eight . 
which child is gonna find the eight ? 
let's show them the picture of the three cows on your door . 
after the seven and before the nine . 
that's where an eight belongs . 
the nine belongs after the eight and before the ten . 
so we're gonna spend another five or ten minutes and then we're gonna go  to find him in the car . 
we can give one to each  child in the school . 
every child can have one cookie . 
does everyone have one ? 
Paradarrot doesn't have one . 
both hands or just one hand ?
the one that's up on that table . 
that one up there . 
I think I see one over here . 
that one's  a .
do you remember what this one is ? 
you know this one .
what's this one ?
that one goes here , doesn't it ?
do you wanna do one of the new .
oh , you wanna do that one ?
that's a pretty hard one .
well , you know there's another new one .
that's a new one . 
okay , let's  see where that one goes . 
eight !
eight .
this is number eight .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
that means there will be eight pieces along the bottom edge also . 
let's  see , those two pieces have some sky . 
what about that one ?
wanna try that one ?
wanna try that one ? 
wanna check that one out ? 
and the next piece below that would be one that has a straight edge and some fe:rns .
one straight edge . 
this has one straight edge and some ferns .
and then the next piece would have one straight edge and some tree trunk . 
a corner piece is a piece that has two straight edges , right ?
that has two straight edges , there and there .
wanna try that one ?
right , when it's all done there should be four corner pieces cause  there are four corners in this rectangular puzzle . 
one , two , three .
we only need one more  corner piece . 
so I see one and I think I'm gonna put it here cause  I think it's gonna go there . 
hmmm , I think this one . 
I think this brown dinosaur might be a really big one . 
I see one under you there . 
oh , so try that one over here now .
I'm gonna try this one . 
I noticed that one was . 
like the one that's in the other puzzle ? 
I'm just gonna see if that's a spinosaurus , number six . 
which one is that one ?
and one more piece with sky . 
maybe the one near your knee .
all around the perimeter except for that one .
now we only have two more pieces to match . 
another one ?
here's one of them . 
this one I will put you back in the barn . 
where's the other one ?
and one cat . 
let's leave one side of this open . 
oh , you can pretend the other is one there you know . 
one evening where was the fox ? 
dangerous one , hmmm ...
it's eight o'clock , it's kind of time to brush . 
well when you're tired it's one thing , but because you're old enough you can drink without spilling from a regular cup . 
I usually do it one at a time . 
get one all the way on . 
here , put her hands right up like that and put one of the sleeves right over . 
do one arm at a time . 
one at a time is a good way to do it . 
it's that green one right there , isn't it ? 
there's one foot . 
now her other one stretch that sleeve way out there , yup  . 
okay on this , there's only been about five or ten minutes . 
interval between the last tape and this one . 
we could put two of these together to make his desk . 
the treadmill also has like two handles . 
let's get one more ye small yellow lego . 
a pink one ? 
the one that's a pullout sofa that greatgrandma slept on when she was with us . 
yeah , you know which one I mean ? 
yeah there might be just one , I don't remember . 
if there's two or one . 
oh , there are two tables see ! 
one on that side ... 
and one on that side . 
and there are two lamps too .
because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another . 
yeah I gave you a different brush cause the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper , see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper ?
I think green is the only one you haven't had . 
you mean you're done painting that one ? 
so now you have three colors . 
if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green ...
so this way you can use more than one brush . 
one for each color if you want to . 
it's seems like I do get a picture , almost every day you've given me one . 
are you done with this one , do you want me to put it aside ? 
you don't want the white one ? 
do you wanna make another one ? 
another one for Dad ? 
yeah I know , but you made two for me and one for him ! 
you can make two for me and two for him . 
you haven't had one for awhile and now you do have a lot of paint on you . 
today is February third  and we're just about one week late in recording .
okay that pause was only  about two minutes long . 
three in a row , I think . 
three in a row .
hop up my ladies , three in a row . 
actually , I see one right there . 
three cups of reserve poaching liquid . 
o:h yeah , that's a good one .
twoandthirty , three and four and five and sixandthirty .
well , one sec .
yeah , she was gonna miss two weeks .
and I still haveto figure out if I'm here next week or not , but anyway so it's just three of us tomorrow . 
since it's only three of us , and it's gonna be sh . 
I just bought one of those huge rolls of brown paper at homedepot today that is great .
could it be in the toy basket that's in the livingroom , the one that looks like this ? 
hmmm seven twentynine ? 
oh yeah that's one way to do it .
and then at one o'clock you can take the bandaid the blanket off . 
okay this chick needs to be in a little tiny tiny blanket is there anything we can get , how about one of those blue socks on the floor over there . 
number five .
number five oh .
this little bear needs a checkup because he just turned three years old . 
well , there's two pieces of wood making up that tree . 
so , only about five minutes has elapsed since I stopped recording . 
let's  play this for five more minutes and then we'll get on  some . 
I'll make some milk out of this one . 
oh , that one needs medicine ? 
that's one of the things I don't like about that gym class .
but this one , I don't know if there's music or not . 
it's almost four .
about five six seven hours of work , so I'm gonna do .
probably an hourandahalf , be home by fivethirty , six .
one of the animals can eat the corn cob . 
why , you're right , it's not very soft , cause I didn't put this one in my bra . 
that one wasn't . 
I was just handling that one . 
I don't know if there's one way to call roosters . 
we have two roosters , don't we ? 
remember , when you first got the barn all we had was the Holstein and the calf , Holstein calf , and the barn cat , one of the barn cats ...
well I bought it , but it's a present from Mommy and Daddy , even though I was the one who actually got it at the store . 
today is March eighth two thousand four .
so there was only about five minutes that I wasn't taping because I was checking to see I taped properly . 
what's the cost how much does that one ?
okay I'll give you two dollars . 
well we'll have one .
oh boy I know that restaurant I like that one . 
do you wanna leave this here this one ? 
this one does . 
oh it's five o'clock . 
he's getting another one we've gotto teach him not to swallowing those .
I carry one end and you carry the other .
let's put it on his wrist everybody in the hospital's gotta have one of those . 
usually he eats supper at seven . 
oh I didn't give you another one .
now I'm gonna think of another one for you .
I will stay here for five more minutes and play for five more minutes and then I'm really going to go and do that whether or not you come with me .
ninety eight point six perfectly fine . 
you might feel like you have a temperature but you don't really have one . 
ah it was almost five minutes . 
well not zero nursing but you didn't wake up to nurse until fourthirty .
you saw a big role of black tape I think may be you use that one up did you ? 
yeah you also used the red one up .
I'll go get one . 
and Daddy was the first one . 
Daddy was the first one who saw you .
it's the stress of turning three .
one for Daddy and one for me , okay .
hey , one two three four five .
he has five friends coming to his party . 
the car might be one of his presents ? 
that one's  for me to read ? 
each one has a number .
let's  see , maybe there's only eight . 
I think there's only eight . 
I don't see a nine .
can we tell which is the highest one and which one is the lowest ? 
we have one very young baby . 
that young baby was just three months old , I think . 
right , she has two mommies .
and there's two children .
two girls , two sisters .
well I kindof designed the cake and made um oneandahalf times the recipe thinking I wanted just one layer and small pan so that there's no leftovers . 
so I had one piece of chocolate shipped . 
who's the blue one ? 
where do you think that one goes ?
oh , there's one piece behind you . 
you're gonna do it one more time ? 
one more time and then brush your teeth .
there's two .
you need to take those two apart . 
what one are you gonna start with ? 
I think it's four .
number four . 
eight .
there are two kinds of chard this year .
you have two kinds of bean seeds is that right ? 
either that or they're in one of the cooler bags . 
or the one in Wellfleet ? 
Naima I think there's one right over there . 
oh well , again you could put two halves together and make a whole one . 
Naima this is one that's  cut on the diagonal . 
but that goes together and makes a whole one . 
I don't think that one . 
these two halves  will make a whole one . 
two halves of a half block . 
well this is almost one of those but not quite . 
but if you put those two ramps together they would make a whole one of those . 
no not this one . 
the other one . 
that one . 
to make one of those . 
but you know what you need to do is to grow one . 
the one guy I know who used to grow apples organically switched over to ... 
the one son comes up from North Carolina ... 
when you ate it for breakfast the other day that was the last one . 
no don't use that one Naima that's . 
are you gonna give me one more little piece ?
I mean I was wondering if that was actually a bear that knocked this one down . 
any more than one male at a time . 
if you count the number of legs it's not eight legs . 
you picked me up one place . 
just had the usual  presentation of six different meals to her highness . 
I'm on f one . 
you put three of the pink flower pieces together . 
this one goes down here because it's this bud .
there's two birds , so let's  look for .
I just put all the bird pieces in one spot for now .
does it have one sm , one flat side ? 
I got that one up here .
we're still missing one more corner piece . 
probably missing one edge piece here .
you were sitting on one piece . 
I don't think we have a place to put that one yet . 
those two go . 
we got two ears already . 
and we need one more edge piece right there .
all four edges .
we only have one , two , three , four , five ...
I think we have nine . 
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight ... 
nine .
you just did a new one , sweetie .
here , you can pick out which one .
what's that one ?
can you find the four ? 
four is the number that goes with fourth . 
remember how the two drum tapes were slightly different ?
I think one of them has the new songs and the new version of drum and the other one has the old version of drum . 
that means you  you go the animals and you figure out which animal is the most sick because the animal who is the most sick ise the one that needs to be seen by the doctor first . 
two ear booboos ? 
two is quite a few . 
two ear booboos and a lantern in the belly . 
two can play at that game , ya  know . 
see , the wall is one end ...
three year old ... 
one more . 
I only have one more . 
then that one bed . 
two . 
two years old . 
just turned two ?
two is a little early anyway . 
they don't start right at two .
til this January so she was like two and three quarters . 
she was walking in between the two front seats .
just one second I'm gonna just get a garbage bag .
yeah I'll get you one in the freezer . 
the blue one . 
what's one of the favorite things you can do there ? 
it's one person work . 
what are some other types of one person work at school ? 
what's a type of two person work ? 
seeing the longest one in ? 
oh , seeing the longest one in , I don't know .
she laid nine eggs .
so , how much is two plus three ? 
then we should have gotten two , so the only question is , this is on two ...
he just turned two months old . 
and you are eight , I see .
is that one person work , or more than one person work ? 
what other kinds of one person work are there at your school ? 
most of the work is one person work , isn't that right ? 
and then there's a few things that are two person work like pancakes and what else ?
you want this big one ? 
or just that one ? 
that's a shape that has  one , two , three , four sides .
one , two , three , that was four sides , that shape . 
a triangle has three sides , right ? 
that also has four sides . 
you mean three sets of four ? 
four plus four plus four ? 
here's a set of four , here's another set of four , and here's another set of four . 
one ...
three sets of four makes twelve .
you could make three sets of four rubberbands , too , and then count them . 
and that one , too . 
this one is called Oil Spill . 
and  did we read this one yet ? 
I think that Oil Spill is the one I was thinking of . 
mmmm oil spills happen when big , big , big boats like this that are carrying crude , it's called crude , oil from one country to another have an accident of some kind and they spill their oil into the ocean . 
no one knows how many of them were killed . 
it keeps the oil in one place . 
one type works like a giant vacuumcleaner .
one type of skimmer , I guess this is the skimmer machine , lifts the sheet of oil and oily debris , that means garbage , out of the water . 
one way . 
one way to save oil is to use less  electricity ! 
let's  see , this is a stage two book . 
why don't we get one of your stuffed animals to be and animal in the ocean when the oil spills ? 
there's at least one duck , and there could be others that I can't see from my window . 
that was probably one of the worst blizzards that Cape Cod has had in the last fifty years . 
so you're not gonna be Miss Chaos in this one are you . 
so that means it's only one dollar . 
uh , let's see one two three four ...
it's six dollars , please . 
okay , six dollars here you are . 
six dollars . 
you're open from ten to one ? 
well the other thing that's one of his favorite foods that we're out of is frozen seal sticks . 
he's six .
almost two days now . 
one more time , huh ? 
seven more minutes .
oh , I want this one . 
I want this one . 
there's two here . 
well you can tear that one in half . 
we're going to put one here ...

in that one ?
oh  we have three more .
oh  we have four more .
do we have four more people ?
there's one more .
you have one with a hat like that  don't you ?
you know we could take one of these out and put them in another one .
which is the little one ?
that's the littlest one .
that's kind  of little though because this is the real big one .
remember this is how the one you got works too .
here's another one .
oh that one fits .
two yellow ones  huh ?
there's another one .
