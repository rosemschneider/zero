97,Bernstein/Interview/amelia2.xml,[None],[0], maybe si  seven words one two probably has two 
98,Bernstein/Interview/anne2.xml,20,[4.0], u to three at least u she only skips five so number five so i m consistently skips number five 
99,Bernstein/Interview/anne2.xml,20,[4.0], i think she really start counting because in the gym we u she takes a gym class and she goes one two three jump 
100,Bernstein/Interview/anne2.xml,20,[4.0], she likes to really repeat uh like songs i mean we ll sing the same song ten times 
101,Bernstein/Interview/anne2.xml,20,[4.0], u a very small baby like she ll help peter my nephew s um seven months she helps him do everything i mean much too too vigorously 
102,Bernstein/Interview/anne3.xml,[None],[0], and she ll always go by rote one two three four five si  seven eight nine ten 
103,Bernstein/Interview/cindy2.xml,22,[2.0], she ll tell him what she s done in two or three words like if she s gone out stroller riding 
104,Bernstein/Interview/cindy3.xml,24,[2.0], no i the cats are growing up the kitten that grandma had is now a cat and our cat s an eight year old cat u it s just she s getting older and there 
105,Bernstein/Interview/cindy3.xml,24,[2.0], one or whatever she ll count to see if it s one two she s doing really well up to four and then five goes a little crazy 
106,Bernstein/Interview/cindy3.xml,24,[2.0], i m not sure i tell her what they are the roses only came out only two they just came out about a week ago so she got to see another rose and vine but the zinnias and the marigolds they re about si  feet tall they re just way above her head and all she wants to do is pick the flowers when she goes out 
107,Bernstein/Interview/cindy3.xml,24,[2.0], she doesn t eat out of glass bowls the big bowls like that and we really have a lot more plates than we have of bowls her her dish is a plastic dish with the three sections in it or a wooden bowl it s a very flat wooden bowl she eats soup out of the plastic three sectioned plastic bowl but it s a whole different very obvious bowl and she does eat soup out of it 
108,Bernstein/Interview/dale1.xml,[None],[0], she s got a raggedy ann and a another soft no she s got three of and a big one but she just isn t interested 
109,Bernstein/Interview/dale1.xml,[None],[0], yeah it seems like an easy thing to memorize y know one two three four i don t think so 
110,Bernstein/Interview/dale1.xml,[None],[0], seven bunnies 
111,Bernstein/Interview/dale2.xml,19,[6.0], she has about eight or ten books 
112,Bernstein/Interview/dale3.xml,21,[1.0], i don t care if she doesn t perform perfectly at two years old but if by the time she s three and she still isn t then maybe i ll i would take a different viewpoint or maybe with a different child i don t know what s normal what s proper and what s not 
113,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], and he went out and he asked her how many there were and she counted one to one up to si  and there were si  of them 
114,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], he removed one and he asked her how many there were and she said i ve forgotten whether she counted up to five or whether she just said 
115,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], five 
116,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], i mean i hadn t sat down and taught her one two three 
117,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], because she had a doll on her one crib machine and he felt that was so e pensive to go out and spend five or si  dollars on one or even just to have another toy was a little doubling it up 
118,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], this one was only a buck ninety nine 
119,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], yes because we ve been to the zoological u museum at harvard we ve seen the museum about four time this spring to look at the aninals animals and u she s also been to stoneham zoo three or four times so she knows the difference between she knows the difference between the zoological museum and the zoo i mean she knows that they re in cages and glass cages and they don t move and she does know what an animal is 
120,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], she knows all of make way for ducklings she knows all of this all of that everything and she s reading a lot of her old her older sister s books vintage when she was four or five years old she loves stories with content i got these little golden books hansel and gretl loves it and she seems to be able to sit through to the very end just enjoying the words 
121,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], she s been starved for three days ever since her attack of gastroenteritis 
122,Bernstein/Interview/gail2.xml,[None],[0], and today was the first time she s had bananas and wheat cereal without any milk in three or four days 
123,Bernstein/Interview/kay2.xml,16,[0], she has been around no less than si  or eight people a day for the last two weeks and she d always get the right shoes back to the right person 
124,Bernstein/Interview/kay2.xml,16,[0], i ask her that about five times a day 
125,Bernstein/Interview/kay3.xml,18,[1.0], yes but the reason that i called you now is because we re going away for a rather long vacation so about si  weeks yeah that s why i had to do it this week and that s why i was so nervous when i couldn t find you 
126,Bernstein/Interview/lena3.xml,24,[1.0], she seems to know two in fact she s three because i can remember her saying that 
127,Bernstein/Interview/marie2.xml,20,[1.0], was it si  weeks ago that we were here 
128,Bernstein/Interview/marie3.xml,22,[0], i guess she s been going full time for four weeks
